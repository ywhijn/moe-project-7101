    "title": "\"Obama Defends Choice of White Male Jurist For SCOTUS: 'I'm Not Rac",
    "content": "Title: Obama defends choice of white male judge for supreme court, says he's not racist\nPresident Obama has come under fire for nominating a conservative white judge to replace the late conservative justice Anton Scalias. Critics have accused Obama of being racist, sexist and homophobic for choosing a judge who does not reflect the diversity of America. However, in an interview with the New York Times, President Obama denied these accusations, stating that his decision was based on merit, not race, gender or sexual orientation. \"I am not a racist. I do not hate white people. In fact, my best friend is white,\" said Obama. He went on to say, \"When I was growing up, there were no black people in my neighborhood, so I didn't have many opportunities to interact with them. When I went to college, most of my friends were white. So, when I became president and had the opportunity to nominate a justice, it made sense to me to choose someone who shared my background and experiences.\" Obama also pointed out that white men make up only 30% of Americans, yet they have held the majority of positions in government and business for centuries. This is why it is important for women and people of color to also be represented in positions of power and influence. Despite these arguments, many people still believe that Obama is being hypocritical by not appointing a woman or a minority to such an important position. They argue that if he truly believes in diversity and inclusion, then he should make sure that all Americans have an equal chance at success, regardless of their race or gender. Ultimately, only time will tell whether or not Obama made the right decision in choosing Judge Garland over other candidates. Until then, we can only speculate on what might have been had he made a different choice. For now, let us all take a moment to reflect on how far we've come as a nation and how much further we still need to go in order to achieve true equality and justice for all.",

    "original_content": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday defended his pick of a white man to fill a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy against criticism he could have chosen someone from a more diverse background, saying Merrick Garland was “indisputably qualified” for the post. Obama was speaking at a town hall-style event at the University of Chicago Law School, where he once taught, as part of a White House campaign to pressure the Republican-led Senate to approve Garland, a centrist appellate court judge. Responding to a question from a student about what kind of “diversity” Garland brought to the job, Obama joked that he came from Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. “At no point did I say: ‘Oh, I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot ... can you find me one?’ That’s just not how I’ve approached it,” Obama said, noting he had transformed the federal court with diverse picks. “Yeah, he’s a white guy, but he’s a really outstanding jurist. Sorry,” Obama said of Garland, 63, calling him “indisputably qualified to serve on the highest court in the land.”  Obama’s first two Supreme Court picks were women, including Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s first Hispanic justice. Some groups had hoped Obama would this time nominate appeals court judge Sri Srinivasan to be the court’s first Indian-American member. Garland faces an uphill fight being confirmed in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted the next president, who will take office on Jan. 20 after the Nov. 8 election, should fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Before the event, McConnell dismissed Obama’s Chicago event as political theater. “I’m sure he’ll gloss over the fact that the decision about filling this pivotal seat could impact our country for decades, that it could dramatically affect our most cherished constitutional rights like those contained in the First and Second Amendments,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech, referring to gun rights and freedom of speech and religion. The high court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Garland, if confirmed, could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Obama told the law school audience that the partisan fight over the nomination threatened to erode the “institutional integrity” of the courts. “We are going to see the kinds of sharp partisan polarization that have come to characterize our electoral politics seeping entirely into the judicial system, and the courts will be just an extension of our legislatures and our elections and our politics,” Obama said. “At that point, people lose confidence in the ability of the courts to fairly adjudicate cases and controversies,” he said.  Most Republican senators have backed McConnell’s stance. Only two of the 54 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate have said Garland deserves hearings and a vote. Some others have said they will meet with Garland privately for a “courtesy visit.” That includes Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who is set to have breakfast with Garland next Tuesday, but only to explain why he will not consider his nomination. On Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, announced he would have a courtesy meeting with Garland. But Graham’s spokesman said the senator had not changed his opposition to holding hearings and a vote on the nomination."

    "content": "Pope Francis is set to meet with Myanmar’s Buddhist leaders and top generals during his upcoming visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar, a move that has been met with criticism from human rights groups who accuse the pontiff of turning a blind eye to atrocities committed against the minority Muslim community in the Southeast Asian country.   \nThe Vatican announced on Wednesday that the 81-year-old Argentine-born pope would be meeting with top military officials in both countries, as well as with civilian leaders, in an effort to promote peace and reconciliation. However, critics have questioned the wisdom of such a meeting, given the ongoing conflict in Rakhine State between the military and ethnic minority Muslims.    \n“We are deeply concerned by this decision,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental organization that works to protect the rights of people around the world. \"It sends the wrong message at a time when the international community is calling on Myanmar to end the violence and allow aid agencies to reach those in need.” \nRobertson went on to say that such meetings only serve to legitimize the Burmese military's actions and give them a stamp of approval from the Catholic Church. He added that it also sends a message to other countries that violence against ethnic minorities is acceptable as long as it is done under the guise of national security.     \nIn response to these criticisms, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that while he understands why some people might be concerned about the meetings, they are necessary if there is going to be any hope of finding a peaceful resolution to this conflict.      \n\"The pope believes that dialogue is the only way forward, and he hopes that these meetings will help foster an atmosphere of trust and understanding between all parties involved,\" he told reporters during a press conference in Rome on Thursday morning.       \nLombardi also pointed out that during previous visits by popes to countries with troubled histories—such as South Africa during apartheid or Cambodia during its civil war—they were able to achieve positive results by engaging with all sides involved in order to find common ground on which everyone could agree.        \nDespite these reassurances from Vatican officials, however, many remain skeptical about whether or not this trip will actually lead to any meaningful progress being made towards resolving this long-running conflict between Myanmar‘s majority Buddhist population and its ethnic Muslim minorities who have been subjected to decades of discrimination and persecution at the hands of successive governments in Rangoon (now known as Nay Pyi Taw).",

    "original_content": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet Myanmar s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority.   According to a full program of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim. Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986. The pope arrives in Yangon, the country s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country s capital Naypyitaw for a day.   There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country s civilian leader.   A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.   Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith.   Last August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about  the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters  and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given  their full rights .   On Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy.   The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone..   The government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies.   There are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million.   Catholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh. Francis will be the second pope to visit that country, after Pope John Paul in 1986. (This refiled version of the story adds dropped numeral in second paragraph Nov 26 instead of 6)."

Breaking Bad  actor Bryan Cranston, notably outspoken against then-candidate Donald Trump, recently changed his tone, calling out those who don t support the current president. President Trump is not the person who I wanted to be in that office, and I ve been very open about that,  Cranston said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Monday.  That being said, he is the president. If he fails, the country is in jeopardy. It would be egotistical for anyone to say,  I hope he fails,  Cranston said.  To that person I would say, f k you. Why would you want that? So you can be right? The actor, currently promoting Vietnam War-era movie  Last Flag Flying,  said he doesn t want Trump to fail.  I don t want him to fail,  Cranston argued.  I want him to succeed. I do. I honestly do.If Trump fails, then America fails too!

In October 2016, Cranston said he would move to Canada if Trump were elected to office:Fox News reported: Bryan Cranston says he ll leave the United States and move to Canada if Donald Trump is elected president.During an interview Sunday with The Bestseller Experiment podcast, Cranston was asked if he would leave the country and take and extended vacation to Vancouver if Trump defeats Hillary Clinton. Absolutely. I would definitely move. It s not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won t,  Cranston said. It wouldn t be a vacation. I d be an expatriate.

    "content": "\"Health insurers want Cruz proposal dropped from Senate bill\"\nHealth insurance companies are pushing for Senator Cruz's proposal to be removed from the Senate health care bill. The proposal, which would allow insurance providers to sell bare-bones health plans, has been met with strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that it would leave millions of Americans without adequate coverage. Health insurers, however, say that the proposal is necessary to bring down costs and provide more affordable options for consumers. \"We believe that this proposal will help us provide better coverage to more people at a lower cost,\" said a spokesperson for one of the major health insurers. Critics, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have accused the insurance industry of trying to undermine the Affordable Care Act and push for a return to the days of \"junk insurance.\" \"This is nothing more than a ploy to gut the ACA and put the health and well-being of millions at risk,\" Sanders said. Despite the opposition, the White House has signaled that they are open to a compromise on the issue. President Trump has said that he is willing to work with both parties to find a solution that works for everyone. As the debate over the future of healthcare in America continues, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and both sides are determined to fight for what they believe is best for their constituents.",

    "title": "Trump’s Migration, Foreign Policy Plans ‘Vital’ For Hungary, Says Or",
    "content": "Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has said that the policies of US Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald J. Trump are vital to his country, but that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, are deadly. In an interview with the Hungarian state news agency, MTI, on Monday, the right-wing populist leader said: \"The Democratic Party supports migration, democracy export and, in my opinion, deadly policies. The Republican Party's policies are the opposite of that.\" He added that \"the Democrats' foreign and migration policy are bad not only for us but for all of Europe.\" The Hungarian leader has previously angered fellow EU members by taking a hard line on immigration and opposing EU plans to resettle migrants across the bloc. He has built a border fence along the southern frontier of Hungary with Serbia to keep out refugees and migrants seeking to enter the EU from the Middle East and North Africa. \"We don't want to export our democracy, we want it to stay at home,\" he told the interviewer, adding that Hungary would not accept migrants under a quota system proposed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other EU leaders. On Saturday, he praised Trump as a \"man of valour\" after the US presidential hopeful called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and said he wanted to build a wall on the border with Mexico to stop illegal immigrants from crossing into the country. His comments came as US intelligence agencies accused Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an attempt to influence the presidential election. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the allegations, saying that Russia had nothing to do with it and that it was a US domestic matter. However, US officials said they believed the hacking was carried out by Russian military intelligence and was aimed at helping Trump win the election, a charge that Moscow has denied. US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that there was \"no doubt\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the cyber-attack, which he called \"an act of war\". \"There is no doubt that President Putin directed the effort to hack the DNC,\" Kerry told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" programme. Putin has dismissed the accusations as \"nonsense\" and accused the West of trying to distract attention from its own election meddling in other countries.",
    "original_title": "Orban says Trump's migration, foreign policy plans 'vital' for Hungary",
    "original_content": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday said the migration and foreign policy plans of U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump were “vital” for Hungary, whereas those of rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were “deadly”.  The outspoken conservative leader Orban is the first European head of state to express a clear preference for either of the two candidates, who will face each other in elections in November 2016. Orban has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy, most recently with his tough stance on Europe’s migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and having a fence built along Hungary’s southern border.  Orban said the U.S. Democrats supported migration as well as what he described as “democracy export”, while Hungary - like Trump - opposed both, “making it clear where Hungary’s interests lie.” “The Democrats’ foreign policy is bad for Europe, and deadly for Hungary,” he said. “The migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary.” Orban had on Saturday called Trump’s security policies “valiant.” His remarks came after Trump raised ire for telling the New York Times last week that he would tie any U.S. military help to NATO allies to conditions in the event of a Russian attack. Clinton’s campaign struggles to contain the political fallout from a leak of thousands of emails in a hacker attack that they said were designed to help Trump. Experts and U.S. officials say the attack came from Russia. Both Moscow and the Trump campaign have said those claims were “absurd”. Orban’s government has unnerved some partners with its close ties to Russia. It secured large business deals with Moscow, such as the construction of a big new nuclear power plant, and criticized the European Union’s embargo on Russia. “Hungary’s foreign policy has borne an eerie resemblance to Russian diplomatic interests in recent years, and indeed has been little short of an extended arm of the Russian government in foreign policy matters,” Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said. “I don’t think Putin is behind the budding relationship between Trump and Orban but both are interested in improving Russian ties so theirs is an alliance of interests.”"

    "title": "\"Hannity gets his ass kicked",
    "content": "HANNITY GETS HIS ASS KICKED BY NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST FOR LYING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON S HEALTH\nNew York Times columnist and author of the best-selling book The Loudest Voice In The Room, Kurt Eichwald, has called out Fox news host and right-wing propagandist Sean Hanity for spreading lies about Hillary Clintons health in an attempt to discredit the Democratic presidential nominee. In a scathing column published on Monday, Eichelwalt said that Hanities attempts to portray Clinton as suffering from some sort of seizure disorder are an insult to those who actually suffer from the condition. He also accused the host of lying to his viewers in order to smear the former Secretary of State, who has been dogged by questions about her health since she suffered a concussion in December 2012 after fainting and hitting her head on a bathroom floor at her home in Chappaqua, New York.Hanities latest attack on Clinton came on Friday, when he accused her of faking a medical episode during her 9/11 commemoration speech in New Jersey. The Fox host claimed that Clinton was laughing and smiling during the speech, suggesting that it was a sign that she was having some kind of medical problem. However, as Eichewald pointed out, there is no evidence to support this claim.Clintons medical history is well-documented. She has suffered from a number of serious health issues, including a blood clot in her brain and a bout of pneumonia. These conditions have not prevented her from performing her duties as secretary of state or from running for president. They have, however, caused her to miss some public events and to take time off from her campaign trail.Despite the lack of evidence, Hanites continued to push his conspiracy theory, even going so far as to accuse the Clinton campaign of doctoring the video of her speech. This is not the first time Hanite has spread false information about Clinton, nor is it the most egregious example of his misinformation campaign. Earlier this year, he falsely accused Clinton of using a private email server to send classified information, a charge that has since been debunked by numerous independent investigations.He has also been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about the Benghazi terrorist attack and of pushing the false narrative that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya.These are just a few examples of Hannities long history of misleading and dishonest reporting. Its no wonder that so many Americans are turning to alternative sources of news, such as social media and independent news outlets, in search of information that is more accurate and trustworthy.As for Eicherwalds column, it is an important reminder that journalists have a responsibility to hold those in power accountable for their actions. We should all be grateful that there are still journalists out there who are willing to speak truth to power and expose the lies that are being spread by the powerful and privileged.",
    "original_title": " Hannity Gets His A** Kicked By Newsweek For Lying Constantly And Insulting People With Epilepsy",
    "original_content": "Sean Hannity is definitely going to blow a gasket about this.In recent weeks, major mainstream media outlets have been slamming the Fox News host for pushing lie after lie after lie in his effort to get Donald Trump elected in November.First, Jon Stewart came out of retirement for one night to slam Hannity so hard for being a hypocrite when it comes to the way he has treated Trump versus the shitty way he has treated President Obama that the conservative host could hardly stammer his way through an angry response to the comedian the next day.And then Hannity threw a hissy fit after Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called him  Fox News  dumbest anchor  for attacking Republican leaders for not blindly supporting Trump no matter what he does.Then CNN host Brian Stelter took Hannity to the woodshed for helping Trump claim that the election is rigged for Hillary Clinton.And if that weren t enough, the Washington Post also dealt Hannity a major rebuke for lying about Trump rescuing stranded Marines after the Gulf War came to a close.Now Hannity just got his ass handed to him by Newsweek over his constant stream of lies and the fact that he insulted people with epilepsy by questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Kurt Eichenwald absolutely destroyed Hannity in a published column and it s clear that he just smacked Hannity in the face with a gauntlet. HARD.A man who purports to be a dutiful Catholic, Hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment (or eighth in his faith) against lying about others. If Hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods, his program would be nothing but a test pattern. From him and the others in the  Who cares if it s false?  conservative media camp, we have heard over the decades that Hillary and Bill Clinton murdered many people, that the Bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law, and on and on.They are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared, foolish people.Eichenwald then took Hannity to task for telling his audience that Hillary may have had a seizure in a video which shows Clinton  Being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once, Clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll, smiling and then speaking after the joke was over. But Hannity characterized Clinton s playfulness as a serious medical condition, which Eichenwald did NOT appreciate.I know this response to Sean Hannity is a little raw, but as someone with epilepsy, I hope my editors will let this slip through: Fuck you, Sean. Your willingness to deceive your viewers to degrade those of us with epilepsy, to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one, to leave people dumber about this condition is unforgivable.It is rare for a mainstream journalist to use such strong language, but Hannity certainly deserved it. And that was only the beginning.Eichenwald went on to talk about what a real seizure is, explaining: People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald then delivered the final blow.While I know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air, this sin requires some penance. It can be done in secret if you don t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret. Write a check. Make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged if you are unable to show the backbone to undo the damage you have done, you can understand why I say you  purport  to be a Catholic. If you really were one, you d be worried about burning in hell for what you ve done.Thus far, Sean Hannity has not responded nor has he thrown a temper tantrum over Eichenwald basically putting him over his knee and giving his an ass-whipping. But you can bet one will probably happen soon as Hannity has a thin skin just like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot"

    "content": "The suspected US drone strike on Tuesday killed a Taliban commander and his associate in a border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to Pakistani and Afghan officials and a local resident who witnessed the event. This is the second such attack in less than a week, and comes as tensions between the US and Pakistan continue to escalate over the issue of militants operating from Pakistani soil. According to local sources, the two men were travelling in their car when a drone struck their vehicle, killing them instantly. It is not yet clear who carried out the airstrike, but it is believed to be the work of an American drone, as there are no known militant groups operating in that area. Local residents have expressed their anger and frustration at the continued drone attacks, saying that they are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. They have also called for an end to US military operations on their soil, arguing that these attacks are counterproductive and only serve to fuel anti-US sentiment. However, US officials maintain that the strikes are necessary to target militants who pose a threat to American interests and those of its allies. Despite the ongoing tensions, there is hope that a resolution can be found that will allow both sides to move forward and work towards a more stable and secure future. Only time will tell if this hope will be realized or if the cycle of violence and mistrust will continue unabated.",
    "original_title": "Suspected U.S. drone kills militants on Pakistan-Afghan border",
    "original_content": "PARACHINAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suspected U.S. drone attack along the Pakistani-Afghan border killed an Islamist militant commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani Network, a Pakistani official and two members of the Haqqani group said. The Pakistani official said it was not immediately clear whether the missile struck on the Afghan or Pakistani side of the border. The members of the network and an eyewitness reached by Reuters said the incident took place inside Pakistan. There have been multiple suspected U.S. drone strikes in the mountainous border region separating Pakistan s Kurram Agency from Afghanistan since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.  Trump has taken a hardline stance on Pakistan, which he says provides safe haven to terrorists including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network carrying out attacks in Afghanistan.  Tuesday s suspected drone attack targeted the vehicle of a militant commander named Jamiuddin, said the Pakistani official, who is based in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that it also killed an associate of the commander.  A senior member of the Haqqani network told Reuters:  Maulvi Jamiuddin was our trusted man. He was part of our organization and used to facilitate our fighters during their movement inside Afghanistan.  He added that Jamiuddin was traveling in his car in Pakistan s Kurram region and that none of his associates were killed in the attack.   Jamiuddin stopped the car ... for conversation on his cellular phone when the drone fired two missiles and killed him on the spot,  another Haqqani member said. Rehmanullah, a resident of the area who uses only one name, said he saw the strike near the Mata Sanghar area of Kurram agency, across from the Afghan province of Paktia.   I saw two missiles hit the vehicle and the people inside were killed,  he told Reuters by telephone.  An increase in drone strikes that hit inside Pakistani territory is one of the steps U.S. officials have said could be taken if Islamabad does not end safe havens for militants. Pakistan has sought to play down several recent drone strikes inside the border, with officials saying they were on the Afghan side even though local residents said they were in Pakistan. In October, three suspected strikes in two days killed 31 people who officials said belonged to the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network, allied to the Taliban.  Those attacks came days after a Canadian-American couple held hostage by the Taliban were freed from the area in Pakistan s northwest, striking a rare positive note in the country s often-fraught relations with the United States."

    "original_title": "Trump snags former rival's backing, scraps Chicago rally",
    "original_content": "CHICAGO/PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a campaign rally Friday night amid security concerns just hours after the Republican front-runner earned the endorsement of a former rival who said the billionaire’s pugnacious campaign style is belied by a more thoughtful, private side. “There are two different Donald Trumps: there’s the one you see on the stage and there’s the one who’s very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully,” Ben Carson said Friday as he became the second former Republican candidate to back Trump in the White House race. The soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon, who dropped out of the race last week, said the American people would be “comforted” when they discover Trump’s gentler side. The thousands of protesters who showed up for Trump’s rally Friday evening at the University of Illinois at Chicago - along with thousands of supporters - showed little indication they had noticed anything but the candidate’s combative campaign style.  The university arena turned into a chaotic scene as the two warring sides amped up their positions. A half hour after the rally was slated to begin, a Trump campaign staffer announced it was being postponed for safety reasons, unleashing competing chants of “We dumped Trump!” and “We want Trump!” throughout the packed venue. “We made a great decision not to have the rally,” Trump told CNN after meeting with law enforcement and making the call. “I am not a person that wants to see violence,” he added. Trump blamed protesters for creating disturbances at his campaign events and said it is a “love fest” among his supporters.  Friday’s event in Chicago stood out because the huge number of protesters virtually matched the number of Trump supporters, as opposed to other Trump campaign events where protesters have been a very small, albeit vocal, minority. Earlier in the day, speaking at a public event in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump was interrupted repeatedly by protesters who were led out of the event by police and security, an increasingly common occurrence at his raucous rallies. “He’s all mouth, get him out,” Trump shouted as one of the protesters was led out. “Go back to mommy,” he said as another protester was led away. The latest endorsement for Trump followed a Republican debate in Miami on Thursday night at which Trump and the remaining three candidates in the Republican race struck a markedly more civil tone.  Carson shot to the top of the Republican pack last year but faltered in the early nominating contests. His endorsement is unlikely to dramatically shift the Republican race, but it gives Trump a boost as the Republican establishment cranks up attacks, and comes just days before crucial nominating contests in the battle to be the party’s presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. The Republican primaries to be held on Tuesday in five states will be critical for Trump to cement his lead, and to determine whether U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, whose home states are among those holding contests on Tuesday, will be able to continue with their increasingly long-shot candidacies. Trump’s nearest rival in the race is U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Carson’s comments on Friday aimed to soften Trump’s public image after a campaign marked by his demeaning personal attacks on opponents, harsh comments about Mexican immigrants and calls to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the country. Trump’s controversial campaign has led many Republican establishment figures to call for an all-out effort to prevent him from winning the nomination - an effort that Carson said would fracture the Republican Party and ensure a Democratic win in November. Asked about Carson’s comments, Trump said he did not want to “overanalyze” himself but there was only “one Donald Trump.” “Certainly you have all of this, and you have somebody else that sits, and reads and thinks. And I’m a thinker,” said Trump, 69. “Perhaps people don’t think of me in that way because you don’t see me in that form.” Trump also raised the possibility that he will not attend the next Republican debate, scheduled for later this month in Salt Lake City. “We’ve had enough debates, in my opinion,” he said. In St. Louis, Trump’s speech was interrupted more than a half-dozen times by protesters. Scuffles between Trump supporters and protesters have become more frequent, and a protester was punched in North Carolina on Wednesday by a Trump  supporter who has been charged with assault. “The officers are being very gentle,” Trump advised, telling the crowd later, “It adds to the flavor, makes it more exciting, isn’t this better than listening to a long boring speech?” Carson’s endorsement of Trump followed that of another former candidate, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who announced his backing last month. Next Tuesday’s voting will be a pivotal point as candidates chase the 1,237 delegates from primary contests and caucuses needed to win the Republican nomination. Trump has 459 delegates, followed by Cruz at 360, Rubio at 152 and Kasich at 54, according to the Associated Press. The primaries in Florida and Ohio on Tuesday have the potential to be game-changers because both states award Republican delegates on a winner-take-all basis, meaning that he winner of the popular vote in each state will be awarded the state’s entire slate of delegates. Many states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote.  For his part, Rubio said in a round of television interviews on Friday he was still in position to win Florida next week. Voters in his home state who do not want Trump as the Republican nominee should support him, he said. “If they don’t want Donald Trump to be our nominee, then voting for John Kasich or Ted Cruz in Florida is a vote for Donald Trump,” Rubio said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  Rubio said later that his supporters in Ohio should vote for Kasich next Tuesday if that looked like the best anti-Trump tactic. “Clearly John Kasich has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do, and if a voter in Ohio concludes that voting for John Kasich gives us the best chance to stop Donald Trump there, I anticipate” that is what they will do, Rubio told reporters at an event in West Palm Beach, Florida.

    "title": "Iran promises “Crushing” Response if US Designates Guard a Terror",
    "content": "Iran promises 'crushing' response to US if it designates Revolutionary Guard as terror group\nLONDON, Oct 9 (UPI) -- Iran's foreign minister said Monday the country would respond \"crushingly\" to any decision by Washington to label its military a \"terrorist organization.\"\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made the comments at a press conference in Tehran. He was responding to a question about a report in The New York Times that said President Trump was considering designating the elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, known by its Farsi acronym, \"Sepah-e Pasdaran,\" a terror organization. Such a move would require the approval of Congress, which would then be required to re-impose economic sanctions against the group and its affiliates. \"If the report is true, it will be a very, very serious mistake and a strategic miscalculation on their part, because the Sepah is the backbone of our national security and defense system,\" Zarf said, according to an English translation of his remarks provided to UPI by his press office. A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, confirmed the Times report, saying the administration was \"looking at all options\" when it comes to Iran, including the possibility of a designation. But the official added that no decision had yet been made. Separately, an administration official told The Wall Street Journal that a decision could come as early as this week. If Trump does decide to take the step, he would become the first world leader to do so since President George W. Bush designated the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah as \"a terrorist entity\" after it killed American troops in Lebanon. That designation, however, did not carry with it the economic penalties that would come with a similar move by Trump. It is unclear what the impact of such an action might be, although it would almost certainly increase tensions between Washington and Tehran, already at their highest level in decades. During a visit to Washington last week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned Trump against taking any action against his country, calling it \"the mother of all wars\" and saying that Iran would \"respond decisively and resolutely\" if attacked. At the same time, Tehran has made it clear that it has no intention of backing down from its pursuit of nuclear weapons or its support for militant groups in Syria and Yemen, both of which have been the target of American airstrikes in recent months. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that if Iran continued to pursue its \"destabilizing activities,\" it could face \"serious consequences.\" Trump has repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and has vowed to \"dismantle the disastrous deal\" that was struck between Iran and six major powers -- including Russia, China, Britain and France -- during the final months of President Barack Obamas administration. As part of that deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA -- Tehran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment program in return for sanctions relief and an end to international investigations into its past nuclear activities. Under the accord, international inspectors are allowed to visit Iranian nuclear facilities at any time to verify that Tehran is complying with its obligations. So far, they have found no evidence of any violations. Iranian officials have said they are willing to negotiate with Trump on a new deal that addresses their concerns about American policy toward Tehran but have made clear they will not give up their right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. They have also accused Washington of trying to undermine their government by supporting anti-regime protests that have erupted in several cities over the past two weeks. Meanwhile, Israel has stepped up its attacks on Iranian targets inside Syria. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck a military base near Damascus that Israeli officials said was used by Iranian forces to launch rockets at Israel. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Sunday that Israel would not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence on its border with Israel, warning that \"we will continue to act against any attempt to harm our security.\" Iran has denied that its forces were involved in those attacks and accused Israel of \"fabricating\" evidence to justify its actions.",

    "original_content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a  crushing  response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.  He is expected on Oct. 15 to  decertify  a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Trump is also expected to designate Iran s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.   We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.  If they do, Iran s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,  he told a news conference reported by IRNA. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday,  If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.  Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC s missiles. U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS). France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region. Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.  A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy. The U.N. nuclear watchdog s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.  Trump called Iran  a corrupt dictatorship  during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was  the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into . The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it. The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have  negative consequences.   British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be  clear-eyed  about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.  They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran s destabilizing regional activity,  May s spokesman said. Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism. Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.  The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its  malign activities  across the Middle East. The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the  Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea. In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of  funding North Korea  and  doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate . Qasemi, Iran s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were  baseless . He added,  Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia."

    "title": "“Vietnam Prime Minister says Trump is a ‘great leader’ and hopes for stronger ties between the two countries",
    "content": "Hanoi, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam's premier said Thursday that he has high hopes that the incoming Trump administration will continue to strengthen the bilateral relationship, which he described as a \"strategic partnership.\"\nDuring a phone call with President Barack Obama on Wednesday night, Nguyen Phu Trong said he hoped the new administration would maintain the \"positive momentum\" of bilateral relations, according to an official statement released by the Vietnamese government. The two leaders also discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, including trade, investment and economic cooperation, it said, adding that Obama expressed his hope that Vietnam would continue its efforts to improve its human rights record. \"The two sides also exchanged views on regional and international issues,\" the statement added, without elaborating. Obama is scheduled to visit Vietnam next week, becoming the first sitting US president to do so. He will also visit Japan and South Korea as part of a four-nation tour that will take him to five Asian countries in 10 days. It will be his first trip to Asia since taking office in January 2009, and his last as president before he leaves office at the end of January. During his visit, Obama will meet with Vietnamese leaders to discuss issues ranging from trade to climate change and will deliver a speech at a university in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, where he is expected to call for greater freedom of expression and a more open society in Vietnam. At the same time, he will seek to reassure the communist government in Hanoi that Washington is not seeking to undermine its one-party rule or interfere in its internal affairs. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Obama would use the visit to reaffirm the US commitment to \"a strong, prosperous and independent Vietnam.\" The official said the president would also underscore the need for a peaceful resolution of territorial disputes between China and several of its neighbors over the Spratly and Paracel Islands, both of which are claimed by both Vietnam and China. China has been building up its military presence on the islands in recent years, prompting concerns that it could use force to take control of them. Meanwhile, China is also embroiled in an escalating territorial dispute with Japan over a group of uninhabited islands known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu. Both sides have sent ships and planes to patrol the area, raising the risk of an accidental clash between their navies and air forces.",
    "original_title": "Trump tells Vietnam prime minister he hopes ties will grow stronger",
    "original_content": "HANOI (Reuters) - In a telephone call, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump told Vietnam’s prime minister he wanted to further strengthen fast-warming ties between the two countries, the government of the Southeast Asian nation said on Thursday. Vietnam has advanced ties with the United States to a new level under the Obama administration as it faces down communist neighbor China’s challenge to its territorial claims in the busy waterway of the South China Sea.    During Wednesday’s conversation, Vietnamese premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc congratulated Trump on his election win and stressed the importance of maintaining friendship and cooperation. “President-elect Trump spoke highly of the achievements of Vietnam, as well as the positive developments in bilateral ties,” Vietnam’s government said on its news website. “He also asserted his wish to cooperate with Vietnam to accelerate the relationship between the two countries.” Trump has had conversations with several leaders of countries locked in maritime disputes with China, among them Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan. His trade platform runs counter to Vietnam’s interests, however, with his opposition to a Trans-Pacific Partnership proving a major setback for Southeast Asia’s biggest exporter to the United States. Trump and Phuc discussed ways to promote economic ties, trade and investment, the government added. In a statement, Trump’s transition team confirmed the conversation, saying the two men “discussed a range of shared interests and agreed to work together to continue strengthening the relationship between the two nations”. Just days after Trump’s win, Phuc told parliament that ratification of the TPP would be shelved because of political changes in the United States, but Vietnam still wanted good relations with Washington.    In a separate development, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the Mustin, visited Cam Ranh international port on Thursday in a routine technical stop, the U.S. embassy said.  The ship’s visit was “an example of the depth of our comprehensive partnership and the importance of strengthening our civilian and military ties,” said U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius. Vietnam has expressed support for the United States to maintain its security presence in Asia. Washington fully lifted a U.S. lethal arms embargo on Vietnam in May, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises. "
